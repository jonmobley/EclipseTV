# Eclipse: notes for Claude

- **PTZ Camera** (OBSBOT) comes from the shared package `~/apps/CamTail/Packages/CamTailKit`
  (also used by the CamTail app). All camera-control feature code belongs there, never in
  Eclipse; Eclipse only hosts it (tile `LibraryThumbnailCell+PTZCamera`, hero
  `LiveHeaderView+PTZPreview`, AirPlay `PresentationViewController+PTZCamera`, controls
  `LibraryGridViewController+PTZCamera`). After any CamTailKit change run
  `~/apps/CamTail/tools/build_all.sh`, which builds and tests both apps.
- Device builds need the NDI SDK at `/Library/NDI SDK for Apple` (linker flags in the
  EclipseiPhone target, `[sdk=iphoneos*]` only).
- Known failing unit test on main (not ours): `LiveHeaderViewCountdownTests.
  rebuildingCountdownChromeKeepsDigitsUnderTheDissolve` (verified 2026-10-02 against main).
